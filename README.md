Coral Island Help :)

Way to transfer saved data from Xbox Game Pass to Steam Coral Island.

I went to: `%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Local\Packages`

Looked for a folder with Coral Island in its name and found **HumbleBundle.CoralIsland_q2mcdwmzx4qja **

Then navigated to select ‘**SystemAppData**’ then ‘**wgs**’

In there is a folder with lots of numbers and letters as a name

In there I opened the folder with the newest date

In there are two files, one with numbers and letters as a name and one called "Container.73"

I copied both files to my desktop

I started the game in steam to make sure the right folder exists.

I exited the game and went to: `C:\Users\USERNAME\AppData\Local\ProjectCoral\Saved\SaveGames`

I copied the two files from my desktop into that folder

I changed the name of the file with the numbers and letters to **DailySave_1.sav - ⚠️ important to add the .sav **

I started the game an there was the right save




Way to transfer saved data from Steam to Xbox Game Pass Coral Island.
go to the appdata folder for the steam version which will be called endeavor and make a copy of the DailySave_0.sav ename the copy to just DailySave_0

take that file and go to the windows appdata for Coral island which will be under users> local >packages >HumbleBundle.CoralIsland_q2mcdwmzx4qja > systemappdata> wgs

click on the long numbered save file

should be 4 long named files here, go into them to find files that if opened in notepad will look somewhat the same as the DailySave_0 file opened in notepad

what I did was copy the DailySave_0 file into the folder, then copied the long numbered files name and deleted it, and then renamed the DailySave_0 file to whatever the file name was in the folder except for the one that doesn't look the same in notepad. for example, the ones I replaced all had exact same writing but one out 4 at the Middle of the notepad file. another one was a lot shorter or locked very different writing in notepad and I did not touch that one at all i just Deleted the original 3 and replaced the 3 that looked the same and did not touch the last one.

when I started up the game, I had my maxed Skills, Purple Tools, and my Town Rank, Museum, Ocean and Heritage. was already finished giving me all the achievements I would have unlocked from Steam on to my XGP. :)

also the ProjectCoral-Win64-Shipping.CT Cheat Table for Cheat Engine only works for steam Version. :)
